# üéÑ Advent of Code 2024 ‚Äì Java Solutions

Welcome to my solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024), written in **Java**.  
This repository contains daily coding challenge solutions, organized by day, with each folder containing the source code and the input used for that puzzle.

The goal of this project is to practice problem-solving, clean code, and to improve Java proficiency.
